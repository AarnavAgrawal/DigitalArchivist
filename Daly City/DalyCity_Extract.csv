"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",37.8271784,-122.2913078,7,"This was the strongest shock felt in the San Francisco area since 1906. Felt land area was approximately 12,000 square miles. (See map, page 195.) Magnitude 5.3. Maximum intensity VII. No lives were lost; about forty minor injuries reported. Damage of all types was estimated by engineers to be in the neighborhood of one million dollars. Principal building damage occurred to one- and two-story wood-frame houses in the Westlake Palisades tract west of Daly City along the ocean. Several dwellings in this tract sustained structural damage. The 1,600,000-gallon reinforced-concrete Westlake Palisades water reservoir (partly underground) had a 4-foot-long crack on one side extending upward from the ground. The largest of several landslides completely blocked State Highway No. 1 near Mussel Rock, and the shoulder of the highway pavement was extensively cracked. Building and dwelling damage in San Francisco was slight and consisted mainly of cracked plaster and broken windows. The road pavement (on unconsolidated soil and fill) along the southern edge of Lake Merced sloughed off into the lake, and both ends of a 200-foot-long pedestrian bridge collapsed. It was reported 2,395 emergency calls were received by plumbers, with 1,500 coming from the home areas south of Sloat Boulevard and north of the Colma cemeteries. There were 856 water heaters damaged, 125 of which required replacement; 62 toilets replaced; 175 wash basins damaged or fractured; 245 toilet tank covers broken; 173 boiler steam lines fractured or broken; 97 broken sewer lines; 422 fractured, broken or bent gas supply lines. At the Colma cemeteries some headstones fell and many were twisted. About forty-four brick chimneys at Daly City were pulled down by the fire department up to 26 March. All strong-motion seismographs in San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland were operated by this shock, also the instrument located on the Carquinez Bridge at Martinez."

"San Francisco, CA",37.7749295,-122.4194155,6,"Press reported buildings in San Francisco were severely shaken, but no serious damage occurred. The State Building at Folk and McAllister Streets had numerous plaster cracks, also the California Building at 515 Van Ness Avenue, where a light fixture fell on the third floor. Plaster fell from walls and ceilings in the Hall of Justice. Walls cracked and a skylight broke at the City Hall. The Presidio branch library at Sacramento near Baker was closed due to damage. The McCreery branch (built about 1903) on 16th near Market was condemned. The brick building was declared structurally unsafe. Repairs to the Presidio branch included chimney top, hanging light fixture supports, and plaster cracks. Several other branch libraries suffered damage, including the Ocean View branch at 111 Broad Street which was closed for five days. Steel book racks in the Main Library at the Civic Center moved during the shock, spewing books on the floor, but no damage was done to the building. No serious damage was reported in any of the city's hospitals. At the Mary's Help Hospital, 145 Guerrero Street, plaster was cracked and loosened on the upper floors. Loose masonry or falling mortar on upper floors caused the police to rope off areas at Post Street and Grant Avenue, at 140 Sansome Street, and at 625 Polk Street. The Seventh Day Adventist Church at 2897 California Street reported two long cracks in the steeple. Chimney fell at 3977 Clay Street and one was badly damaged at 420 Frederick Street. At Stonestown many windows were broken in one of the large apartment buildings. From the top floor of one of the 13-story Parkmerced Towers apartment building, a resident reported the building rocked and rolled, knocked all the lamps down, and cracked all the plastering. The house looks like a wreck. It was reported the top floor of St. Anne's School, 1330-14th Ave., was badly damaged. Glass was broken in more than 400 city-owned street lights, mostly along Great Highway, Sunset Boulevard, Sloat Boulevard, and Junipero Serra Boulevard. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company had similar damage in the Richmond district. The PG&E's biggest chore was reconnecting gas water heaters. Most plumbing damage occurred west of Twin Peaks, generally in the area along Nineteenth Avenue, on Sloat Boulevard, east on Ocean Avenue to San Jose Avenue, and south on San Jose Avenue to Daly City. Grocery and liquor stores in San Francisco had fairly heavy damage from bottled goods breakage. The Safeway stores at Alemany and San Jose Avenues, and on West Portal Avenue, were a shambles. Plate glass windows buckled at the Alemany Store. Store front windows were shattered along Balboa Street from 35th to 40th Avenues in the Richmond district, and on Irving Street between 20th and 23rd Avenues in the Sunset district. All front windows of the Littleman supermarket, 1630 Ocean Avenue, were broken out. It was reported light poles waved like reeds in the breeze at the Civic Center. Bells rang at St. Patrick's Church, Mission near Third Streets. A painter working on the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge said the tower shook like a tree in a gale. The deck of the bridge galloped up and down and the suspenders (cables) slipped back and forth. He ran to get off the bridge. At least 20 windows broke at the Administration Building and Toll Plaza. Bay Bridge authorities reported no structural damage and traffic moved smoothly. But it was a real hard shake, said one employee. The Sheraton-Palace Hotel had a broken plate glass window and broken crockery. The telephone company reported no serious damage to its system, although many telephones were out. Repairing damage to the pipe organ located in the Civic Auditorium (Civic Center) was estimated to cost $300. Air pipes broke and a portion of the organ called the harp unit fell askew when the 7,320 pipes were shaken. Scores of motorists on Bayshore Highway stopped immediately after the shock, thinking they had a flat tire. One motorist said, We felt a shuddering sidewise motion."
"San Francisco Schools, San Francisco, CA 94102",37.7516075,-122.424074,6,"The following reports on San Francisco schools were taken from reports received from the State Department of Public Works, Division of Architecture. None of the damage found was of such a nature that would endanger life and all the schools inspected were back in session. With the exception of two schools, Presidio Jr. High and Sheridan, where the chimneys suffered some damage, and the San Francisco City College, where some ceramic facing tiles fell off, all the damage observed consisted of cracked plaster on furred walls and fallen portions of plastered ceilings, particularly in buildings having wood lath. It can be generally stated that schools built prior to the Field Act suffered greater damage than those built after 1933. Most of the modern schools went through the earthquake practically unscathed. The following schools were selected for inspection after discussions with city officials brought out the fact that most of the damage was reported from schools falling in a line roughly paralleling the San Andreas Fault."
"Presidio Jr. High, 29th Ave and Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94121",37.7818352,-122.4891836,6,"Three-story reinforced-concrete and steel-frame structure. A r.c. chimney rises about 35 feet above roof. Ornamentations atop this chimney became loose and fell off. One piece, weighing about 350 lbs., fell into the paved court and another fell through the skylights on the top floor which, being of r.c. flat slab construction, suffered no damage. The chimney proper, probably r.c., does not show any sign of damage. An old vertical crack through the concrete wall showed at the junction of two wings of the building. Horizontal and 45° shear cracks appeared in the plaster of the stairwell."
"George Washington High School, 31st Ave, between Geary and Balboa, San Francisco, CA 94121",37.7765721,-122.4760413,6,"Three-story r.c. structure, built in 1936. The school has large window openings. Music room and auditorium added in 1952. No damage. Hardly any plaster cracks."

Extensive plaster cracks, particularly in the stairwells at the junction of the plastered stud wall and concrete. On the exterior the corners of what appeared to be a bond beam at the top of the elevated first floor showed spalling."
"Sheridan School, at Capitol and Farallones St, San Francisco, CA 94112",37.7140825,-122.4565478,6,"Three-story stuccoed-wood-frame building, built in 1909, with r.c. walls up to the elevated first floor level. This building is practically identical with the Farragut School. Extensive plaster damage was noted, particularly in the stair walls, running horizontally. A 14-foot-high brick chimney tied together with angle irons fell off in sections. One bracing strut in the attic space broke, probably as a result of the impact suffered when the chimney hit the roof. Plaster ceiling was also damaged. It was also noticed that an empty water tank in the attic broke loose from its pipe connections."
"Longfellow School, at Lowell St, near Mission, San Francisco, CA 94110",37.7114465,-122.4464077,6,Built about 1907. First story r.c.; second story wood-frame. This school is just about to be replaced by a new building. The stairwell shows extensive horizontal cracks. There were also sizeable vertical cracks in the plastered stud wall partitions and ceilings.
"West Portal School, Taraval St, Claremont Blvd, and Lenox Way, San Francisco, CA 94127",37.7423038,-122.4651108,6,"Two-story-type 1/b structure, built in 1927 and rehabilitated in 1932. Reinforced-concrete building. Numerous cracks in the corridor walls in horizontal and vertical directions. Most of the cracks, however, must have been in existence for some time and should be attributed to the result of continuous earth movement rather than to the effect of the recent earthquakes.

"1925 Oak Ave., Menlo Park, CA 94025",37.430454,-122.1909142,6,"Heard low-pitched earth noise for at least 2 seconds before I felt any motion. Then the house vibrated at such a rapid rate I first thought that something had broken in one of the appliance motors around the house and that the vibration was caused by a motor running with unbalanced shaft. Frying pan on the burner of a built-in electric range (mounted on a wall about 4 feet above a concrete foundation) made a terrific noise and seemed to jump up and down, but chairs and tables supported by a more springy wooden floor did not. I concluded from this that the vertical component of acceleration came very close to 'g.' The frequency was not far from the pitch of the lowest note on a piano, and I would say that a vertical motion of perhaps 15-20 cycles/sec and amplitude of nearly a half-millimeter would account quite well for what was noticed in the house. The duration seemed about 30 seconds; however, I imagine it was really closer to 5 seconds. As soon as I realized it was an earthquake, I decided to watch the water in a swimming pool just outside the house. By this time the vibrations had slowed down somewhat, and the surface of the water was covered with small waves (wave length perhaps 4 inches) moving in a N-S direction; so it seems that the initial motion also had a N-S component. There was a period of a few seconds of comparative quiet, then a very much slower E-W motion started, which set up waves on the pool with a wave length of perhaps 4 feet and an amplitude of nearly 3 inches, almost splashing the water over the coping. The pool is 36 feet long in the E-W direction. Motion of the water in the pool could still be seen 20 minutes later."
