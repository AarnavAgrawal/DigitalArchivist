"San Fernando Valley Schools, San Fernando Valley, CA",34.1825782,-118.4396756,9,"The following is from a report by California Institute of Technology2: Most schools in the San Fernando Valley were post-1933, and these experienced little damage from shaking. Some wood frame buildings were shifted on their foundations, and some cracking was experienced. The foundations of several school buildings, such as Van Gogh School and Sylmar High School, were disrupted by permanent ground displacements, but structural damage was not such as to constitute any undue hazard to occupants. However, in some cases, light fixtures and ceilings, supposedly designed to withstand earthquake shaking, fell and these would have been hazardous. The generally good behavior of the school buildings in the San Fernando Valley is due mainly to the fact that they were well constructed one- and two-story structures, mostly wood frame and plaster, that were significantly stronger than the minimum requirements of the building code. Of the pre-1933 schools, Morningside School at Maclay Avenue and Fifth Street in San Fernando was closest to the center of the earthquake. One of the two structures at this site was a good quality, two-story brick bearing wall building (1928) which was very badly cracked by the ground shaking. Although it would not have injured occupants during the earthquake, it did appear afterwards to be in a most dangerous condition, and it has been demolished. Since the earthquake, most of the old buildings have been closed. A few were judged to be in a good condition and not unduly hazardous to the occupants, and these will be used for a limited period of time.",,,,,,

"13597 Simshaw Avenue, Sylmar, CA 91342",34.3187911,-118.4126745,8,"The first shock was sudden; no warning rumble. I thought it was an explosion. We went up and down, with the noise and jolts accelerating. I can recall four very hard up-and-down motions, the last one being the hardest. The sound seemed ear-splitting--I thought my eardrums would burst. It was impossible to hear anyone, so we just didn't bother. My daughter said she was screaming but not one of us heard her. My husband, a large, strong man, tried to force himself up from the bed but was slapped down each time. Five times he tried, straining with every muscle, until he was exhausted. I had trouble hanging onto the bed. We could hear nothing but the noise of the earthquake. The slapping motion of the earth seemed to be in an east-west direction, with the last slap ending in a hard motion to the west, toward Olive View Hospital. We were shaking between the up-and-down motions. Now we started to roll. I was holding on- to the bed for 'dear life' to keep from being thrown into the furniture. I could see the clock glide across the room. I looked out the window from the bed. The window starts at about 1.5 m. from the floor and goes to about 0.45 m. from the ceiling. I could clearly see the outline of the trees against the sky (it is a 360-acre area, rather open), the tops of the trees, the sky, the dark area of growth, and the very dense area--I expected to see the ground any minute. This was repeated with every roll. At one point I thought the house would go over with the next roll as each roll was worse than the last. That, I believe, was the end of the major motion, as my husband and I jumped out of bed almost simultaneously. It was when we were in the rolls, north-south direction, that I could hear everything falling and breaking. The 'slaps' felt as if one were being blown around and up in the air, then coming down hard, like being in the center of a big explosion. The concussion was unbearable. During the rolls the sound was much more bearable. When we got to the bedroom door we found it was jammed with furniture, including the heavy dresser and the sewing machine, which was upside down. The minute I could get a few centimeters gap in the door, I yelled to my children to get outside, and not to wait for us. My husband had the door cleared in seconds. My four children were huddled in the hall. We were now in the aftershocks. The hall was leaning in first one way, then another. We pushed the children down the hall. We were thrown against each side of the wall all the way to the front door. Then came another hard aftershock, and my husband could not get the door open. As the shock eased, he was able to jerk the door open, bending the middle hinge badly. We were the first ones out on our street. We stood on the lawn and watched Pacoima Dam light up with a hazy glow and then fade. The light came from behind the front of the dam and was a steady light, not a flash. There were lots of slides and dust. We could hear lots of large rocks rolling down off the dam area, and thought the dam was breaking. We left the children in the car, which was bouncing up and down with every shake. By now, people were starting to come out of their houses. I just sat in the middle of the yard, I was so dizzy and dazed. The ground was bumping up gently, and I noticed that I was sitting on one of the cracks in the yard but I just didn't care. I saw people who looked simply frightened 'out of their lives' and some who looked absolutely blank. We felt as though we had been through an explosion. It wasn't until we were in the aftershocks (in the hall) that I suspected it was an earthquake. We returned to the house a minute or two at a time to gather shoes and robes. It took us 2-1/2 hours to find my husband's glasses even though he knew where he had left them. At daylight, we were amazed to find the house structurally intact, as we had been thinking it would be totally ruined. Inside, however, it was a mess, taking over 3 weeks to straighten it up. The house has a slab floor and drywalls, and stood up well. We had about $181 in structural glass damage, even the shower doors were broken. Our neighbors on both sides of us were not so lucky. In general, things were scattered in a very even pattern throughout the house. I took a straight pin, which was embedded about half way in, out of my bedroom wall. I have written down most of the details as I remember them and given a lot of thought to them, trying to be as exact as possible, if anyone could be exact through it. I asked my doctor how Pacoima Lutheran Hospital was and he said, 'Bombed!' Somehow that just explains things perfectly.",,,,,,
"22117 Sierra Highway, Sylmar, CA 91342",34.3372623,-118.504481,10,"All other earthquakes that I have experienced were of a rolling motion, but this one felt as if the bottom fell out of everything. I felt a falling sensation, and jumped up to try to get out, but I was knocked down to my knees. I was sitting at the kitchen table when it struck. Everything began to fall; all dishes and glassware crashed to the floor; then in about 5 seconds the light went out. I finally got to my feet, after about 30 seconds, and yelled to my wife to hurry down so we could get outside. If we had been sitting on a big vibrator, it couldn't have shaken us any harder. There was no rolling or horizontal motion. It was a straight-up-and-down motion. A big bookcase and a large commode upstairs fell toward the east. There was no noise as in other earthquakes I have experienced. This one hit without warning. This old house was built in 1915 and is on pretty solid ground. My service station across the street from me was not damaged. About 0.8 km. south of me, near that new freeway that was being built and where so many bridges were lost, there is a mountain that is torn all to pieces--looks as if it went through a grinder. The north side of my house didn't seem to get hit as hard as the south side.",,,,,,

Small objects shifted, overturned, and fell; furniture shifted, overturned, and broke. Plaster cracked, broke, and fell. Windows cracked. This building was moved off foundation approximately 0.3 m. and had to rise over sill at least 11 cm. to settle down without damage to shingles. Firemen were resting in the wood frame quarters building ... Mr.J. White, duty fireman, stated that he was tossed out of bed onto the floor and the bed landed on top of him. Every object in the building was upset. Even the handset of a standard wall phone came off its hook. Loud, cracking and thunderlike noises added to the general confusion. The building was shifted off its foundation. Outside, rocks were thrown off the ground, and large cracks appeared in both soil and rock ... many ground cracks appeared throughout the area. The surface of a hill adjacent to the building exhibited the 'shattered earth' effect reported a few miles to the west. A nearby rock roadcut appeared to have exploded, and the adjacent road was offset in many places ... A 20-ton fire truck in the garage ... moved 6 to 8 feet fore and aft, 2 to 3 feet sideways without leaving visible skid marks on the garage floor. The truck was in gear, and the brakes were set. Damage to the truck was a bent rear step, broken windshield, shattered red light, and siren broken off. Also, a ladder and a hook were broken. Marks which appear to have been made by the right rear tire were found on the door frame ... 3 feet above the floor, while the metal fender was not damaged. The fender extends several inches out beyond the upper portion of the tire. Four feet above the floor the hose rack was broken by the rear step of the truck. The step was bent up while the hose rack was broken downward. The rear of the garage was pushed outward 6 to 8 inches, and the final position of the truck was about 4 feet out the front of the garage, with the garage door resting on the cab. Morrill also suggests that the building accelerated upward, with respect to the ground, at a rate of at least 1 g. for about 0.1 second.",,,,,,

The construction is a single-story wood frame and stucco. Although there was no collapse, there was major structural damage which consisted of buckling of slabs on grade, fracturing of concrete foundation walls, and displacement of bearing walls in the zone of cracked foundations. The lunch shelter columns were permanently bent approximately 15 degrees at the base at the point of weakness created by openings for electrical outlet boxes.

"Patrick Henry Junior High School, Granada Hills, CA 91344",34.260973,-118.5252465,8,"Constructed in 1959. The buildings are primarily one- and two-story reinforced grouted brick and concrete bearing wall structures. The major structural damage consisted of fracturing of four second-story columns of a two-story covered arcade. The concrete roof of the arcade was shored to prevent collapse. The longitudinal concrete wall in the classroom buildings, extending the full length of the buildings, sustained some hairline diagonal cracks near both ends of the building. The cracking can be attributed to shrinkage stresses that existed prior to the earthquake. A concrete curb at the corner of the mechanical penthouse fractured under the steel column at the brace connection. Structural damage was minimal; however, a major loss of lighting fixtures constituted a real hazard. There was nominal damage to acoustical ceiling tile. Electrical conduits were damaged. The damaged arcade has been removed. The entire school is in use. Structural damage at the Van Gogh Street School was reportedly caused by ground surface movement, and damage at the Patrick Henry Junior High School resulted from vibrational movement.",,,,,,

"209 N. Naomi Street, Burbank, CA 91505",34.1615661,-118.3324952,7,"Felt by and awakened all in community; frightened many; general excitement. A number of persons left their houses during the shock; people walked unsteadily. Observer's house (built in 1947) is a well-built, one-story wood frame building with later additions. Other houses in the neighborhood are mostly one-story wood frame dwellings with exterior stucco (built about 1947). This neighborhood is located in southwestern Burbank. Motion in this area was an increasingly rapid, complex shaking for roughly 10 to 15 seconds after being awakened. After the motion had reached a peak, it began slowly to decrease in intensity; however, ground motion did not stop completely until after a considerable length of time; there was a short interval before the next shock. Two roars (very prominently heard in this neighborhood) were emitted from a powerplant about 3 km. from here as the quake caused valves to close as steam shot out. Power was knocked out in this neighborhood and remained out for slightly more than 2 hours. Many plate glass windows at nearby business establishments were broken. A substantial number (about 10 percent) of chimneys in this neighborhood were cracked, several so severely that their upper portions had to be removed. A few chimneys were slightly separated from houses, and the upper portions of a few were very slightly twisted. One straight crack, clearly visible from the street, extended from the base to the roof of a single-story library about 0.4 km. to the north, and several long, conspicuous cracks formed in plaster interior walls of a church about 0.8 km. north of here. Damage in other parts of Burbank: Instances of cracked walls, badly cracked chimneys, shattered windows, and other damage were common in much of Burbank. Some old buildings had extensively damaged walls and ceilings and were considered unsafe. Some of the severe damage included the fall of portions of the exterior walls just below the roofs of a church and a rest home, both relatively old buildings near downtown Burbank, and walls of both predominantly of brick. Although the worst damage was typically to older buildings, minor damage was common in newer ones. In spite of much costly damage in places, at many other places damage was virtually nil. Brilliant, quick flashes of light were seen in various directions (apparently related to effect on powerlines or transformers). In my house a number of things fell from shelves or tables, or were tipped over, or changed positions (as happened, undoubtedly, at all houses near here). A few knickknacks in precarious positions seemed surprisingly virtually unaffected; however, a water softener tank, just outside the house, jiggled off one of its three supports and tilted. The tank is too heavy for one person to move without great difficulty. Nothing in my house was broken. Glassware broke at next-door neighbor's house. Probably some things were broken at nearly every house around here. (Incidentally, relatives living in eastern foothills of Burbank reported figurines in glass dome were turned around even though the dome itself was unaffected. No windows were damaged at our house and none were damaged at most of the neighbors' houses. Our house had no obvious damage. The walls of our next-door neighbor's house developed some narrow cracks in various places. Narrow cracks developed in walls, especially at corners of windows and doors, in many buildings in this neighborhood. Small chips of plaster fell in several buildings. Some garden walls were cracked, several were significantly weakened. This observer reported that more than 120 aftershocks had been felt up to June 21. Ground: Compact alluvial soil, level.",,,,,,
